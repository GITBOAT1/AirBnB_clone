                        <p>Black and Hispanic households continue to be about twice as likely as white households to rent their homes. In 2016, 58% of black household heads and 54% of Hispanic household heads were renting their homes, compared with 28% of whites. But all major racial and ethnic groups were more likely to rent in 2016 than a decade earlier.

                        <p>Renter households are younger, less affluent, and more racially diverse than homeowners. For most of the past 50 years, roughly one-third of U.S. households have rented their homes. Rentership rates rose during the Great Recession, and today remain relatively high, at 35.6%. Rentership rates have increased among some groups that have traditionally been more likely to own, including higher-income households and middle-aged adults. Homeowners are more affluent than renters: The median income of renters was $42,479 in 2019, which is roughly half that of homeowners.
